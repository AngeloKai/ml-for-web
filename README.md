# Explainer:  API Sets for Machine Learning on the Web 

With the recent breakthroughs in deep learning and related technologies, performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have significantly improved. More and more applications have deeply integrated with machine learning functionalities. Along with the growth of ML applications comes with the growing number of ways ML can be applied. One notable method is training machine learning model on the cloud and then porting the ML models to be directly embeded in the client application. Doing so comes with a number of appealing properties, such as performance boost due to edge computing, resistance toward poor or no network, and security/privacy protection, etc. Developers have shown strong interests in the method of deploying machine learning models in web applications as evidenced by the growing number of JS libraries dedicated to this method. However, the current web platform does not have offer proper support and are limiting ways developers can build ML applications on the Web. We can learn from how platforms for native applications offer support and design a proper set of APIs for ML on the Web.
