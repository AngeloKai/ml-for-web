# Explainer:  API Sets for Machine Learning on the Web 

With the recent breakthroughs in deep learning and related technologies, the performance and accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have significantly improved. More and more applications have been released with machine learning functionalities deeply integrated. Along with the growth of ML applications comes with the growing number of ways ML can be applied. One such way is training machine learning model on the cloud and then porting the ML models to be directly embeded in the client application. Doing so comes with a number of appealing properties, such as performance boost due to edge computing, resistance toward poor or no network, and security/privacy protection, etc. Developers have shown strong interests in the method of deploying machine learning models in web applications as evidenced by the growing number of JS libraries dedicated to this method. However, the current web platform does not have proper support and lead to limitations in the libraries. We can learn from how platforms for native applications support this method and design a proper set of APIs for ML on the Web.
