# Explainer:  API Sets for Machine Learning on the Web 

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been significantly improved in terms of accuracy, reliability, and performance in recent years. While typically thought of a technology for the cloud, machine learning have its applications on the device as well. Developing a machine learning model usually involves two stages: training and inference. In the first stage, the developer decides on a skeleton model and feed large dataset to the model in repeated iterations to train the model. Then the model would then be ported to production environment to infer insights based on real time incoming data. While training is typically performed on the cloud, Inference can occur in the cloud or on the device. Performing inference on the device have many desirable properties including performance boost due to edge computing, resistance toward poor or no network, and security/privacy protection, etc.

Although platforms for native applications have all shipped APIs to support machine learning inference on device, similiar functionalities have been missing on the web platform. Supporting such functionalities can not only supercharge existing applications but also unlock new scenarios. For example, with the help of service worker, developers can have their text translation application to be available offline. By inferring the user’s emotions based on user’s input (be it text, image, or video), developers can build a rich emotional experience. Applications on new frontiers such as Mixed Reaility can become much "smarter."

Today when web developers want to develop machine learning models, they face bottlenecks in terms of memory, performance, and power consumptions. Although various existing APIs ease the pain a little, a new set of APIs are necessary for unlocking ML on the web.

The explainer describes the use cases and developer interests that motivate the API, examines existing platform support, demonstrats a few known techniques to break the performance bottlenecks, and sketches out a initial set of requirements for the final API design. It is important to note that machine learning is a broad field. The explainer focuses on some areas (such as neural network) I found particularly interesting but there are other areas that haven’t been mentioned yet. The explainer is written to spark conversations about ML on the web and additions/corrections are welcomes.
